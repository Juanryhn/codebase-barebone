# Barebone Codebase React + Vite

A Barebone Codebase React + Vite project refers to a minimal setup for building React applications with Vite as the bundler and development server. Vite is a modern, fast, and highly efficient build tool that provides a better development experience compared to traditional bundlers like Webpack.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 20.x)
- npm or yarn
- TypeScript
- React Query
- Axios

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Juanryhn/codebase-barebone.git
   cd codebase-barebone
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables (optional):
   - Create a `.env` file in the root of your project if it doesn't exist.
   - Add any necessary environment variables (e.g., `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`).

## Running the Project

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
